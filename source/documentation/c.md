###Capitalisation

DON’T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.

Lower case is preferable but use capitalisation for:

* departments (specific government departments - see below)
* the Civil Service, with lower case for 'the'
* job titles, ministers’ role titles: Minister for Housing, Home Secretary
* titles like Mr, Mrs, Dr, the Duke of Cambridge (the duke at second mention); Pope Francis, but the pope
* Rt Hon (no full stops)
* buildings
* place names
* brand names
* faculties, departments, institutes and schools
* names of groups, directorates and organisations: Knowledge and Innovation Group
* Parliament, the House
* titles of specific acts or bills: Housing Reform Bill (but use ‘the act’ or ‘the bill’ after the first time you use the full act or bill title)
* names of specific, named government schemes known to people outside government: Right to Buy, Queen’s Awards for Enterprise
* specific select committees: Public Administration Select Committee
* header cells in tables: Annual profits
* titles of publications (and within single quotes), for example, 'The Study Skills Handbook'
* World War 1 and World War 2 (note caps and numbers)

Don’t capitalise:

* government - never Government, even when referring to an elected administration, (so not the Afghanistan Government) unless part of a specific name, like Local Government Association
* minister, never Minister, unless part of a specific job title, like Minister for the Cabinet Office
* department or ministry - never Department or Ministry, unless referring to a specific one: Ministry of Justice, for example
* white paper, green paper, command paper, House of Commons paper
* budget, autumn statement, spring statement, unless referring to and using the full name of a specific statement - for example, “2016 Budget”
* sections or schedules within specific named acts, regulations or orders
* director general (no hyphen), deputy director, director, unless in a specific job title
* group and directorate, unless referring to a specific group or directorate: the Commercial Directorate, for example

* policy themes like sustainable communities, promoting economic growth, local enterprise zones
* general mention of select committees (but do cap specific ones - see above)
* the military
